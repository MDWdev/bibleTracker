# bibleTracker
This app will utilize the BibleGateway API to bring in the entire bible. A user will be able to track their goal of reading the bible daily as well as add notes and be able to access them from a calendar.

4/28/25 - I got stuck and haven't been working on this project recently because it's so sorely in need of a refactor. I've decided to move forward with building it in an "as is" state (I am copying things over from a previous project) and therefore give me the opportunity to refactor it publicly later, even though it is painful to build it this way now that I know better!
